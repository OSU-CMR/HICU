# High-dimensional Fast Convolutional Framework (HICU) for Calibrationless MRI
HICU is a computational procedure for accelerated, calibrationless magnetic resonance image reconstruction that is fast, memory efficient, and ready to scale to highdimensional imaging. For demonstration, HICU is applied to multi-coil 2D static imaging, multi-coil 2D dyanmic (2D+T) imaging, and 3D knee imaging.

## 2D
1. One 2D T2-weighted parallel MRI k-space dataset (https://fastmri.med.nyu.edu/) and four sampling masks are in the folder 2D/2D_data. 
2. The HICU reconstruction subroutine for 2D is in **2D/HICUsubroutine_2D.m**. 
3. The optional nondecimated wavelet denoiser is in the file **2D/SWT_denoiser.m**.
4. To implement the reconstruction for 2D, run file **2D/main.m**.

## 2D+T
1. One 2D+T cardiac cine parallel MRI k-space and two sampling masks are in **2D_T/2D+T_Data**.
2. The HICU reconstruction subroutine for 2D+T is in **2D+T/HICUsubroutine_2D_T.m**.
3. To implement the reconstruction for 2D+T, run file **2D+T/main.m**


## 3D
1. One 3D knee parallel MRI k-space and two sampling masks are in **3D/3D_Data**.
2. The HICU reconstruction subroutine for 3D is in **3D/HICUsubroutine_3D.m**.
3. To implement the reconstruction for 3D, run file **3D/main.m**
